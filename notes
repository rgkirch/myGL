when you create a new shader program object it should find the location of all of the uniforms and save them
    i guess this means that there is a kind of ShaderProgram that hass the basic stuff (minimal that i use) and a TexturedShaderProgram (that inheriets from) ShaderProgram that has the stuff of textures

thread safety
    all calls to glfw need to be protected with a semaphore
    some functions may be called from any thread such as glfwMakeContextCurrent
    some functions may only be called my the main thread such as the creation and destruction of windows, contexts, and cursors
    event processing may only be done by the main thread

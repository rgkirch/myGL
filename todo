considerations:
    where are the different contexts saved?
    vector<Context*> contexts;

Any input to the program can be tokens into a queue. You could literally write a grammar for that shit and use a parser generator to gen the code that calls your functions at just the right time.

When I make the readPNG function I should replace the blurlock convert with my own program. blurlock script in /usr/sbin/blurlock

Context:
    Compose: think ms paint
    typing practise. either random words or you can submit some text and it will walk through the text as you type with some visual feedback on your correctness
